Subject: UBF and JSON Protocols
For a long time I have been interested in describing protocols. In
2002 I published a contract system called UBF for defining protocols.
This scheme was never widely adopted - perhaps it was just to
strange...

I have revised UBF and recast it in a form which I call JSON Protocols
- since JSON is widely implemented, this method of described protocols
might be more acceptable...

Subject: Word Frequency Analysis
Hello!

I need to compute a word frequency analysis of a fairly large corpus. At
present I discovered the disco database
http://discoproject.org/

which seems to include a tf-idf indexer. What about couchdb? I found an
article that it fails rather quickly (somewhere between 100 and 1000
wikipedia text pages)
http://knuthellan.com/2009/07/09/the-couchdb-indexer-lightweight-search-engine-in-hours/

Are there other erlang frameworks or can somebody provide me with a hint
to another DBM system which naturally supports wortd frequncy analysis?

Thank you!

Regards,
  Johann

1) ps -A | grep couchdb
   or
2) /etc/init.d/couchdb {start|stop|status}
3) sure you can if you database name will not interfere any other

As I remember couchdb package depends on erlang. So it may be installed
as always in /usr/bin and /usr/lib/erlang
